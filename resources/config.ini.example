[database]
; These parameters configure the mysql connection string:
;   user:pass@host:port/name
user =
pass =
host = localhost
port = 3306
name = statserver

[test]
; These parameters are related to the Apache Configuration
;   url - the endpoint that sendgrid will be configured to post to
;   user/pass - the HTTP Auth user/pass combination for access
;
; Currently only Basic Auth is supported.
url = http://localhost/ssa/callback.php
user = sendgrid
pass = sendgrid

[uniqueargs]
; These columns would be supplied as part of the uniqueArgs field in the STMP
; header of the emails as they were sent. Fields specified in this manner are
; currently required to be present in all emails, this may change in the future.
;
; The general syntax is simple, rigid, and limited to the following:
;   column_name = "type, [ADD INDEX(column_name)]"
;
; The SQL string MUST BE QUOTED because the php parse_ini_file function prohibits
; raw parenthesis in ini files. Additionally, the SQl statements must include their
; own trailing commas with the exception of the last line which CANNOT have one.
; Technically speaking any valid ALTER TABLE syntax can be added after the
; initial type definition but its not encouraged.

; For example, if your mail is processed by several jobs and split into several
; chunks you might want the following simple defintions:
;
;   job_id="int(10) unsigned, ADD INDEX(mailing_id),"
;   chunk_id="int(10) unsigned, ADD INDEX(job_id)"
;
; The above entries will alter the main events table to include two int(10)
; unsigned columns which will be automatically populated with the unique arguments
; supplied by the SMTP events API.

[extracolumns]
; These columns are not referenced or used by the SGA script but
; are columns that a specific deployment might require for other
; processes. Since their values will never be specified on record
; insert, its recommended that default values be supplied.

; For example you may want to mark events as processed (by another
; process) and keep the date for that processing:
;
;   processed="int(1) unsigned DEFAULT 0, ADD INDEX(processed),"
;   dt_processed="datetime DEFAULT NULL, ADD INDEX(dt_processed)"
;
; The above entries will alter the main events table to include a
; int(1) `processed` column and a `dt_processed` datetime column that
; default to 0 and NULL respectively.
;
; The SQL string MUST BE QUOTED because the php parse_ini_file function prohibits
; raw parenthesis in ini files. Additionally, the SQl statements must include their
; own trailing commas with the exception of the last line which CANNOT have one.
